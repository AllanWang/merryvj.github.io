                <h3> Overview </h3>

                <p> During Summer 2020, I [remotely] joined Red Hat's UXD organization as an interaction design intern
                    with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/products/middleware"> App Services</a> team. Here I'll share my process and learnings from working on the Service
                    Registry, an enterprise web application part of Red Hat's Integration suite of middleware products.
                    Red Hat is an open source company – no NDAs on this project!

                <h2> The Red Hat Service Registry is a datastore for developer teams to manage evolving versions of
                    "artifacts"</h2>
                <p> Artifacts can be 2 things: schemas or API designs. These tell developers what the data format being
                    sent and recieved by their applications looks like. As development continues, data needs change.
                    Teams then need a way to keep track of these changes so that they don't write code based on outdated
                    data formats. </p>
                <p> Artifacts have: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Unlimited versions </b>with multiple versions that can be active at the same time </li>
                    <li> <b> Changing metadata </b> (name, description, labels) that updates with each new version </li>
                    <li> <b> Configurable "rules"</b> that control how compatbile new versions are with old ones</li>
                    <li> <b> External documentation</b>, but only if the artifact is an API design </li>

                    let's get some design magic! </h2>
                <p>
                    Red Hat had already released an<a target="_blank" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_integration/2020-04/html-single/getting_started_with_service_registry/index"> MVP "Tech-Preview" version of the Service Registry</a> , with a basic UI
                    created by engineers. My goal was to be the first light of UX this project had ever seen, creating
                    designs that could be used as frameworks for future iterations of the product.

                <h2> Browse all artifacts </h2>
                <p>To access a specific artifact, a developer needs to search or browse through all the artifacts. I
                    assumed and designed for 2 user scenarios: searching for a specific artifact in mind (i.e. by name)
                    vs. browsing to discover a suitable artifact. </p>
                <p>
                    How might we allow users to distinguish between not only the different artifacts types, but 10s to
                    100s of artifacts? Filtering, grouping, favoriting? I explored "artifact groups" at lower
                    fidelities, but ultimately did not prioritize them in my hi-fi deliverables. More user research
                    would have been necessary here to understand searching behavior and which pieces of info are most
                    relevant. <div class="img-holder shadow-sm">

            <p>While the drawer is too narrow to show previews of artifact content, it is much easier to tab through &
                compare items to see if they match what is being looked for. Additionally, the preview drawer pattern
                would be consistent with another closely related Red Hat Integration product.

                <p> Options with sortable table headers are desirable for sorting on multiple dimensions (otherwise
                    would have to fit it into the filter toolbar) and even for screen readers. I also asked developers
                    and found that not all of the explorations were technically feasible with the Patternfly design
                    system. </p>
                <p> Responsiveness was not a big consideration since this product would not be used on mobile devices. I
                    still did consider screen width and resizing behavior with an open preview drawer. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Designing for developers </b> → I have not lived the dev life. But devs on the team
                        recommended me some tools to look at so that I could live up Jackob's Law. All the git stuff,
                        API creators, even IDEs were helpful to observe for common interaction patterns. </li>
                    <li> <b> Only 6 weeks of design time </b> → Prioritize the most "innovative" flows that require the
                        most testing and iteration to design first...and communicate this with stakeholders. For less
                        important flows I relied on references from other products and the Patternfly design system's
                        layout library. </li>
                    <li> <b>When the main stakeholder unexpectedly goes *poof* </b> → Stay calm and carry on! I could
                        have done a better job of updating them on the progress I'd be making / made both before / after
                        they went on break. </li>
