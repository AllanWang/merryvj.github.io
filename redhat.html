        <h3> Overview </h3>

          <div class="col-12">

            <p> During Summer 2020, I [remotely] joined Red Hat's UXD organization as an interaction design intern with the App Services team. Here I'll share my process and learnings from working on the Service Registry, an enterprise web application part of Red Hat's Integration suite of middleware products. Red Hat is an open source company – no NDAs on this project!

            <p>
                As the sole designer on this project, I conducted the UX design process from discovery to delivering high-fidelity wireframes and prototypes. I worked closely with an engineer, product manager, and user researcher.

                <h2> The Red Hat Service Registry is a datastore for developer teams to manage evolving versions of "artifacts"</h2>
                <p> Artifacts can be 2 things: schemas or API designs. These tell developers what the data format being sent and recieved by their applications looks like. As development continues, data needs change. Teams then need a way to keep track of these changes so that they don't write code based on outdated data formats. </p>
                <p> Artifacts have: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b> Unlimited versions </b>with multiple versions that can be active at the same time </li>
                    <li> <b> Changing metadata </b> (name, description, labels) that updates with each new version </li>
                    <li> <b> Configurable "rules"</b> that control how compatbile new versions are with old ones</li>
                    <li> <b> External documentation</b>, but only if the artifact is an API design </li>

                <h2>It can be used without a UI. But it's nicer with one. It's about to become an important product, so let's get some design magic! </h2>
            <p>
                Red Hat had already released an MVP "Tech-Preview" version of the Service Registry, with a basic UI created by engineers. My goal was to be the first light of UX this project had ever seen, creating designs that could be used as frameworks for future iterations of the product.

                <p> Options with sortable table headers are desirable for sorting on multiple dimensions (otherwise would have to fit it into the filter toolbar) and even for screen readers. I also asked developers and found that not all of the explorations were technically feasible with the Patternfly design system. </p>
                <p> Responsiveness was not a big consideration since this product would not be used on mobile devices. I still did consider screen width and resizing behavior with an open preview drawer. </p>
