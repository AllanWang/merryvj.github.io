        <h6> So, who are we solving for? </h6>
        <p> As a read more about Shoppers on Instacart's blog and chatted with two of them online, it was clear that shoppers are extremely diverse. However, shoppers with different skills and experience experienced Instacart shopping quite differently. </p>

        <p> Instacart assumes shoppers are like <strong> Fiona</strong>. Yet from looking at Instacart's shopper <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/shopper-news/shopper-perks-52e480f2788a"> stats</a>, it seems that most shoppers are either newbies or just getting rolling. Helping these people emulate the behaviors of seasoned shoppers can help ensure shopper performance quality and customer satisfaction.</p>
        <p> But no matter how seasoned a shopper is, everyone wants to be better: more accurate and faster.  </p>

        <h6> Pain-point #1: Planning a route through the store</h6>
        <p> Currently, the Shopper App sorts items by a supposed "fastest route". However, many shoppers online have cautioned on trusting this, especially since store layouts change and items may appear in categories that don't correspond with the store layout.</p>
        <p>
          When I posted a thread asking about the ease of use of the Shopper app, I recieved these reponses:</p>
          <h3> "Review the entire list to keep the stragglers in mind when shopping to minimize backtracking. And keep an eye out for randomly placed items."</h3>
          <br>
        <img width=100% src="InstacartImages/RedditScreenShot.png">

        <p> The "cow-path" that shoppers take is to scroll through everything and memorize items before they shop and keep scrolling through the list again while they shop.
