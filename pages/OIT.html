                <h1> The Opportunity </h1>

                <p><strong>Hundreds of thousands of visitors arrive on Duke University's campus each year. </strong>Not only to watch games or tour campus as a prospective student, but to visit attractions like the Nasher Museum of Art and Sarah P. Duke Gardens. </p>
                <p> <strong> We decided to make a visitor app for the Duke Gardens first. </strong> After meeting with multiple stakeholders (including Duke Athletics and one of Duke's executive VPs) , our team decided to use the gardens as a proof of concept for a visitor app that could be expanded to the rest of campus.</p>
                <p> <strong> Did someone say 'Augmented Reality'?</strong> Besides creating a visitor app, another half of our project was focused on implementing the AR technology from our <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/free/search/?&OCID=AID2000061_SEM_JEGssiWT&MarinID=JEGssiWT_324570645539_microsoft%20cloud%20azure_e_c__71931115868_aud-394034018130:kwd-302939704459&lnkd=Google_Azure_Brand&dclid=COCp9Oiw_uMCFQEO5wod-HsBxw" target="_blank">project sponsor</a>. <br>A 5-week-long story short – things didn't work as expected. </p>
               
                <img width="100%" src="OITImages/OITTimeline.png">
      
                <p> <strong>My opportunity was working as a "UX team of one".</strong> Although we had a team lead from Duke OIT, my team members' roles were mostly self-directed. This meant that I wanted to incorporate elements of the design process in our work, I had to shape those opportunities myself.</p>

          <h1> Research</h1>

          <h6> Field visits & interviews </h6>
          <p>My team made several trips to the Duke Gardens to observe visitors, conduct interviews with gardens staff, and to experience the gardens for ourselves. One visit included a tour of the entire gardens offered by volunteer tour guides. </p>
          <img width="100%" src="OITImages/dukegardens.png"><br><br>
          <p>We interviewed gardens staff, from tour guides to the marketing director. They shared with us some of the <strong>most commonly asked questions from visitors:</strong></p>
          <div id="visitorQuotes">
              <p>"Where's the parking lot?"</p>
              <p>"Where's the bathroom?"</p>
              <p>"Where should I go today?"</p>
              <p>"How long does it take to visit?"</p>
              <p>"How do I get out of here?</p>
              <p>"Where can we eat lunch/dinner?"</p>
              <p>"Where is the rose garden?" (asked while standing in the Rose Garden)</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p> We found that <strong>navigating the gardens with a paper map is hard</strong>, especially for first-time visitors:</p>
          <img width="100%" src="OITImages/PastJourney.png"><br><br>

          <h6> User personas </h6>
          <p> From informal conversations with gardens visitors and secondary research, I created 3 "proto-personas" to help guide the rest of our design process. </p>

          <h1> Ideation</h1>

          <h6>Task analysis</h6>
          <p>When my team began thinking about which features to incorporate in our app, <strong>I took initiative in suggesting we use post-it notes to organize our ideas </strong>and try to create a "task analysis". For each key stage in the visitor journey, we added ideas about both what features and information a user would need.</p>

          <br>

          <h6> Sketching together </h6>
          <p>To encourage participation and divergent thinking, I asked all of my team members to sketch out design ideas before discussing our ideas as a group. </p>

          <!--
            <h6> Finding inspiration</h6>
          <p>I observed existing apps to see what worked and what didn't. I took inspiration from the UI patterns of popular travel planning apps in particular.</p>

              <h6>From low up to medium-fidelity</h6>
              <p>Because this project could become part of Duke's suite of mobile apps, I did not define a distinct visual design. I spoke to one of Duke OIT's UX/UI designers and learned that while OIT did not have a mobile design/pattern system, they did sometimes <strong> take cues from Material Design.</strong> I kept this in mind when deciding to use cards, drop shadows, and rounded corners.</p>

              <h6>Getting immediate feedback</h6>
              <p> I asked several other interns at Duke OIT to walk through the wireframes and tell me what they thought each screen’s function was. Everyone seemed to have a good grasp of what the app did, although the concept of “saving” favorite locations sparked discussion. What if it could generate a tour from the saved places?</p>

          <h6>A 4-week time crunch</h6>
          <p> Armed with 3-days worth of XCode training, I began building our app's visual components in XCode's storyboard and writing Swift code to make use of the data my teammates prepared on the back-end.</p> 

          <h6> Staying flexible</h6>
          <p> We had to  <strong>prioritize features that would contribute the most to a minimum viable product</strong> over those that would complicate and lengthen development. I questioned my previous design choices to determine which features were most essential to our app's user experience.</p>
