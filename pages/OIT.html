                <h1> The Opportunity </h1>

                <p><strong>Hundreds of thousands of visitors arrive on Duke University's campus each year. </strong>Not only to watch games or tour campus as a prospective student, but to visit attractions like the Nasher Museum of Art and Sarah P. Duke Gardens. With the upcoming opening of an expensive visitor center, there's plenty of incentive to revamp the visitor experience. </p>
                <p> <strong> We decided to make a visitor app for the Duke Gardens first. </strong> After meeting with multiple stakeholders (including Duke Athletics and one of Duke's executive VPs) , our team decided to use the gardens as a proof of concept for a visitor app that could be expanded to the rest of campus.</p>
                <img width="100%" src="OITImages/DukeGardensBridge.jpg">
                <p> The Sarah P. Duke Gardens is a sprawling botanical garden open to the public, attracting over <strong>300,000 visitors </strong> each year. It is not only a top spot to see on campus, but also the local Durham/Raleigh area. </p>
                <p> <strong> Did someone say 'Augmented Reality'?</strong> Besides creating a visitor app, another half of our project was focused on implementing the AR technology from our <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/free/search/?&OCID=AID2000061_SEM_JEGssiWT&MarinID=JEGssiWT_324570645539_microsoft%20cloud%20azure_e_c__71931115868_aud-394034018130:kwd-302939704459&lnkd=Google_Azure_Brand&dclid=COCp9Oiw_uMCFQEO5wod-HsBxw" target="_blank">project sponsor</a>. <br> We dreamed up possible applications of AR in our app, however as the weeks progressed, we discovered that some of our plans were impossible with our sponsor's technology. </p>
               
                <img width="100%" src="OITImages/OITTimeline.png">
      
                <p> <strong>My opportunity was working as a "UX team of one".</strong> Although we had a team lead from Duke OIT, my team members' roles were mostly self-directed. This meant that I wanted to incorporate elements of the design process in our work, I had to shape those opportunities myself.</p>

          <h1> Research</h1>

          <h6> Field visits & interviews </h6>
          <p>To begin, my team made several trips to the Duke Gardens to observe visitors, conduct interviews with gardens staff, and to experience the gardens for ourselves. One visit included a tour of the entire gardens offered by volunteer tour guides. </p>
          <img width="100%" src="OITImages/dukegardens.png"><br><br>
          <p>We interviewed gardens staff, from tour guides to the marketing director. They shared with us some of the <strong>most commonly asked questions from visitors:</strong></p>
          <div id="visitorQuotes">
              <p>"Where's the parking lot?"</p>
              <p>"Where's the bathroom?"</p>
              <p>"Where should I go today?"</p>
              <p>"How long does it take to visit?"</p>
              <p>"How do I get out of here?</p>
              <p>"Where can we eat lunch/dinner?"</p>
              <p>"Where is the rose garden?" (asked while standing in the Rose Garden)</p>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p> Here's the map that the gardens provides visitors. It's pretty, but it can be tricky to find which twisty path you're on.</p>
          <img width="60%" style="margin: auto; display: block" src="OITImages/Screen Shot 2019-08-17 at 12.12.57 AM.png">
          <br>

          <p> Unsurprisingly, we found that <strong>visitors often struggle navigating using the paper map</strong>. They don't use it every step of their visit, but it is crucial when they need to find a specific place such as a bathroom, parking lot, or iconic landmark.</p>
          <br>
          <h6> The current visiting experience</h6><br>
          <img width="100%" src="OITImages/PastJourney.png"><br><br>
          
          <h6> User personas </h6>
          <p> From observations and informal conversations with gardens visitors, I created 3 "proto-personas" to help guide the rest of our design process. </p>

        <div class="project-wrapper">
            <h6> Understanding stakeholders</h6>
            <p> At this stage, we also completed our initial stakeholder meetings with the gardens and Duke's executive board. We asked about existing initatives and data, in addition to opportunities for revenue-generation. These meetings gave us guidance on which aspects of the visitor experience to focus on, in addition to the <strong>business requirements that aligned with user needs</strong>.</p>

          <h1> Ideation</h1>

          <h6>Task analysis</h6>
          <p>When my team began thinking about which features to incorporate in our app, <strong>I took initiative in suggesting we use post-it notes to organize our ideas </strong>and try to create a "task analysis". For each key stage in the visitor journey, we added ideas about both what features and information a user would need.</p>
          <img style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 60%" src="OITImages/taskAnalysis.png">
          <br>

          <h6> Sketching together </h6>
          <p>To encourage participation and divergent thinking, I asked all of my team members to sketch out design ideas before discussing our ideas as a group. </p>

          <!--
            <h6> Finding inspiration</h6>
          <p>I observed existing apps to see what worked and what didn't. I took inspiration from the UI patterns of popular travel planning apps in particular.</p>

              <h1> Wireframes</h1>
              <h6>From low up to medium-fidelity</h6>
              <p>Because this project could become part of Duke's suite of mobile apps, I did not define a distinct visual design. I spoke to one of Duke OIT's UX/UI designers and learned that while OIT did not have a mobile design/pattern system, they did sometimes <strong> take cues from Material Design.</strong> I kept this in mind when deciding to use cards, drop shadows, and rounded corners.</p>

              <br>
              <h6>Getting immediate feedback</h6>
              <p> I asked several other interns at Duke OIT to walk through the wireframes and tell me what they thought each screen’s function was. Everyone seemed to have a good grasp of what the app did, although the concept of “saving” favorite locations sparked discussion. What if it could generate a tour from the saved places?</p>

        <div class="project-wrapper">
          <h6>Prototyping new features</h6>
          <p> My first set of wireframes were a simple, broad overview of the app. To explore new ideas and user flows in more detail, I created new wireframes and also a clickable prototype. Using the prototype, I asked testers to assume 2 scenarios: 1) Planning their own tour route and 2) Exploring nearby places. </p>

          <div class="project-wrapper">
            <h6>Testing feedback pt. 2</h6>
            <p> This time the other OIT interns were more confused as they progressed through the route-planning taskflow. They were <strong>mostly confused by the concept, rather than by what they saw on the screens.</strong> This suggested that including onboarding might be necessary in order to provide users with enough information to build some sort of a conceptual model for this novel taskflow. </p>
           
            <h6>Shouldn't we verify with actual gardens visitors?</h6>
            <p> Using other interns to test was convenient, but it didn't tell me how much actual visitors would value being able to customize their routes. However at this point my team lead asked us to start coding, and I decided to stop exploring this concept after considering the value it could bring users would not outweigh the disproportionally large amount of time/effort to develop it. </p>

          <h6>A 4-week time crunch</h6>
          <p> Armed with 3-days worth of XCode training, I began building our app's visual components in XCode's storyboard and writing Swift code to make use of the data my teammates prepared on the back-end.</p> 

          <h6> Staying flexible</h6>
          <p> We had to  <strong>prioritize features that would contribute the most to a minimum viable product</strong> over those that would complicate and lengthen development. I questioned my previous design choices to determine which features were most essential to our app's user experience.</p>

          <h1> Takeaways</h1>
          <h6>Knowing when to cut corners</h6>
          <p>In 10 weeks, there wasn't the luxury of progressing cleanly through the UX process like I had seen in books, online articles, and Medium posts. When we were short on time, I applied modified, shortened versions of processes that would deliver just enough value to use. Other times, especially with our lack of user testing, I learned about the drawbacks of not going for the full push and how to compromise. </p>
          <h6> Empathy for users AND teammates</h6>
          <p> Teamwork makes the [UX] dream work! In order to convince my teammates that design was important, I had to step in their shoes. "How could supporting this 'design thing' help them acheive their own goals and ultimately benefit our team's work as a whole?" </p>
          <h6> Parlez-vous 'business'?</h6>
          <p>Since we were designing a new product, business value was key. The current app does not directly support revenue-generation, and this is a hurdle in terms of bringing our app to long-term/widespread production. If I were to do this again, I would consider business, user needs, and technical constraints together at the same time to understand the ways they intersected and how that would translate to a design. </p>
