            </h1>

            <h1>
                I love creating experiences that help people live their best, most joyful lives. I have a fascination with affective design and leverage a mixed set of visual + code chops from 4 years of graphic design and 3 of software development.
            </h1>

            </h1>

            <!-- <h1> I did client-focused graphic design for five years and coding for four, mainly self-taught. Building a multidisciplinary skillset has empowered me to learn by doing. Since 2018, I've been growing through practice projects and work experiences at Red Hat and Daytrip.  </h1>  -->

                <h1>
                    Now in past two years, I've been building skills for product design  through online courses (ðŸ’› Students Who Design) and real-world experience at Red Hat and Daytrip. </h1> -->

            
                <!-- I have an eye for visuals and the guts for talking about
                    code. Most of all, I bring enthusiasm for learning-by-doing and the curiosity to ask lots of "what
                    if"s. -->
                <h1> Currently, I am a junior at Duke University studying how people (and computers) think and

In school, I lead a <a target="_blank" class="lined" href="https://youtu.be/9uGeiU1XEh4">dance group</a> and have led design for <a target="_blank" class="lined" href="https://hackduke.org/">HackDuke</a> and the <a target="_blank" class="lined" href="https://ideate.hackduke.org/">IDEATE</a> design conference.

                I started out in graphic design when I was 13, ran a couple of Etsy shops, explored front-end development, and considered becoming a therapist before discovering UX in 2018. Since then, I've been learning through books, virtual courses (ðŸ’› Students Who Design), and any projects I can shape into a design challenge.
