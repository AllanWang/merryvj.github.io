        <h6> What if there was a place to curate all your internet content? </h6>
        <p> From our favorite memes to Medium articles, what we consume online is part of our Millenial/Gen-Z identities. But besides tagging friends in posts, or messaging them a link or screenshot, there's no good way for us to share these fragments with the people closest to us.  </p>
        <p> As part of joining <a href="https://dukecatalyst.co/">Catalyst</a>, a social and pre-professional organization for tech at Duke, my team and I conceptualized and pitched our idea for a platform we oh-so-cutely named Pluto.</p>

        <h6> Pinterest pins + Reddit subs + Tumblr energy = ?</h6>
        <p> Pluto allows users to aggregate media (such as photos, blogs, videos...and tiktoks?) from other sites. They can curate content alone for themselves or in a shared space with other friends. The goal is for users to be able to look back at what they've curated – with the same type of pride as creating the perfect Spotify playlist.  </p>

        <h6> Brainstorming </h6>
        <p> My team spent 2 whiteboarding sessions defining key user flows and interactions. We tried to answer the following questions: </p>
        <p> 1. How might we organize posts? A feed? Trello-card-style? Or...? <br>
          2. How do we signal the value of a post? Points? Visual goodies? <br>
          3. What is the easiest way for a user to add a new "post"? <br>
          4. What would social interaction look like? Comments? Chatroom?

       <p> One of our challenges was the increasing complexity of our idea – we were even getting ourselves confused! As we were brainstorming we fleshed out an idea of using astrological bodies in space as a mental model. As a user and a designer, I love the extension of metaphors (Desktop folders, Pinterest Pins!). </p>
    
       <h6> Navigating with an astrological mental model</h6>
       <p> Instead of sticking with a classic feed (or even grid view) for displaying content, we experimented with something new. I wondered if we were trading usability for creativity, but nonetheless it was definitely a fun design exercise! </p>
