                <p> OurSpace is a startup that originally addressed the overcrowding and underutilization of spaces in daily life. Born after a series of pivots (starting first in Seoul, then landing at Duke University, then back to Seoul), the DayTrip app encourages people to enjoy their cities by creating a refined space-discovery experience.</p>
                <p> I joined part-time in May 2020 as the latest (but then only) designer when OurSpace was making this pivot. I designed the entire MVP that launched in July, and have been working on iterations and new features since. As of October 2020, it has 1000+ downloads, with 300 WAUs. </p>
                <p> I designed all UI components and screens for the MVP, defining the design direction from scratch. I worked closely with dev to handoff designs. Visual design and branding is also on my plate – which I'm working on right now! </p>

                <p> Think of your favorite spots in town. What was it like when you first found them? Did you wonder "woah, why didn't I find this place sooner?" or "how could this be in [insert city here]?". We dream about exploring other places around the country and world, but how often have we experienced the gems hidden right in front of us? </p>
                <p> Living in bustling places like NYC, Paris, or Seoul with so many sights to see and things to try could be a bit overwhelming. It's easy to stick to the handful of places you already know of – but chances are, those are also the spots also frequented by everyone else. </p>

               <p> DayTrip maintains this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/daytrip_korea/">Instagram page</a>, which gives insight into the types of people we could attract as users. The following are insights from Instagram and conversations David and Cherlyn have had with followers and potential users. </p> 
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong> Instagram is not suitable for offline exploration </strong> – Saving functionality locations is limited. Workarounds include keeping an album of screenshots and using the note-taking app. There is also not enough info/context about locations.</li>
                    <li> <strong> Lack of trust in review-based platforms like Yelp </strong> – There are fake reviews everywhere, and comments by strangers are taken with a grain-of-salt. Recommendations by friends and online influencers have the most weight.</li>
                    <li> <strong> Map services by Google, Naver, Apple, etc. are utility-focused </strong>– There is no inspiration to go to places, and the photos are often unappealing. </li>
                    <li> <strong> Difficult to explore together </strong> – People look for places to go on dates with partners (or friends/family), but planning is scattered across messages and tagging friends in comments on social media.  </li>
                    <li> <strong> Too many options </strong> – Seoul had over 80,000 restaurants alone (compared to 30,000 in NYC) in 2018. It is overwhelming to use services that simply list all these places, even with filters. </li>
                </ul>

                    <li> <strong> Discovering spaces </strong> – Hand-picked cafes, boutiques, picturesque areas, and other hidden-gem date-destinations are listed on the app. Each space has photos and a description submitted by users who are "Curators". </li>
                    <li> <strong> Saving spaces to lists </strong> - Users can save spaces to lists they may add other users to (save spaces together!). Lists can be made public and browsed by all users if desired. </li>
                    <li> <strong> Personalization </strong> - Users can indicate their preferences for the style (e.g. "modern", "luxurious", "quiet") and types of space (e.g. "library", "restaurant") they like. They are recommended spaces and generated personal lists. </li>
                    <li> <strong> Search & Filtering </strong> - The perfect space can be queried through a combo of tags (for style, type, and region) or found on a map view.  </li>
                    <li> <strong> Curators </strong> - Only select users have the ability to add spaces and photos to the app. Currently, these "Curators" are photographers active as influencers on Instagram. </li>

David and Cherlyn also test prototypes (or even the functional implementation) with users and/or friends and relay the feedback. </p>
                <p> Finally, we also monitor Google analytics to measure success and find problem-areas (e.g. What percentage users successfully create an account? Which screen does the most drop-off happen on?). </p>

                <h2> Creating a magazine-like browsing experience </h2>
                <p> The MVP started with an image-based feed of spaces in the first tab. Spaces are displayed one-at-a-time to emphasize the immersive effect of the photos. However, users felt this feed was too monotonous. We also noticed from analytics that people tended to stay on one tab, so other features weren't being accessed as often. 
                    To make the feed more dynamic and to better integrate the other content in our app (i.e. curations), the redesign includes different feed items. </p>

                <p> While beauty is important for this app, efficiency is everything for curators who are repeatedly adding pieces of content.  But the first iterations I designed? They were just not it. Bless Cherlyn's blood pressure for enduring it at least a hundred times before the redesign. She came up with the flow for adding photos (for spaces that already exist) and I created the flow for adding a completely new space. 
                    A sign of success is that curators (other than Cherlyn) were able to learn and use the new flow without any guidance from our team. We're still waiting for their feedback for more improvements. </p>
