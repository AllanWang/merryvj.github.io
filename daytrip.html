                    Daytrip (born out the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ourspace/"> OurSpace </a> startup) makes it easy to discover the perfect spots to enjoy with people you care about: partners, friends, family...and yourself! We give select content-curators a platform to share photos and info about the most special spaces in town. Besides the mobile app, DayTrip also maintains <a href="https://www.instagram.com/daytrip_korea/"> this Instagram page </a> to highlight spaces and curators in South Korea.

                <p> Startups go fast – even if as a designer I prefer taking my sweet time to understand who I'm designing for, and why. I had to whip out some features in mere days within 1-week sprints. Users and future business value guided the development of every feature, so I also had to prioritize which designs were left at MVP-level and which ones to revisit. </p>

                    <h3> Insights </h3>
        

                    <h2> Existing solutions lack in experience and functionality for discovering high-quality physical spaces.  </h2>
                    <p>
                       When we first started in May/June, David and Cherlyn did an initial round of interviews with potential users from the DayTrip Instagram. In these interviews, we wanted to understand how people used existing apps to find new places to go. 
                    </p>
                
                    <div class="img-holder">
                        <img src="daytrip/Problems.png">
                    </div>

                    <br> 
                    <h2> Beautiful photos matter – but they're all on Instagram. </h2>
                    <p>
                        Initially, we had a few hundred spaces with gorgeous photos taken by Cherlyn (and David). Some had been shared on Instagram, attracting over 2000 followers. Check-out the difference between the same place on Google Maps vs. in photos that were taken with skill & care:
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <div class="img-holder">
                        <img src="daytrip/PhotoComparison.png">
                    </div>

                    <p> And there are so many photographers and influencers sharing jaw-dropping photos to Instagram. They promote a lifestyle surrounding the exploration of these beautiful spaces. People love it – the comments are full of followers tagging someone, saying "let's go!".  </p>
                    <div class="img-holder">

                    <h2> 80,000+ restaurants in Seoul. 40,000+ in Paris. 20,000+ in NYC. </h2>
                    <p> South Korea's "cafe culture" is really showing here. And that's not even including all the other places like shops, museums, IG-worthy destinations. It is so overwhelming to use services that list all these places. </p>

                    <br> 
                    <h2> You probably have someone you want to go with. And where do we go next after this food-coma?</h2>
                    <p> Who's looking for new spots to go the most? The lovebirds. "Where do you want to go?" "Idk." People struggle with coordinating plans and "wish lists" when they are scattered across messages and tags on social media. </p>  
    
                    <p> One interviewee also noted how they may go to multiple spots in one outing, but it's a pain to plan out an itinerary or spontaneously find the next destination on-the-go. </p>

                <h3>  Design goals </h3> 
                <h2> Give it the functionality of saving & searching + a whole lot of beauty. It's a brand. It's a vibe. </h2>
                <p> I value the connection between product design and branding. Insights from the preferences of Daytrip's Instagram followers (majority women in their 20s-30s) shaped the visual design decisions I made for the UI. Especially since the first touch-point for users is our Instagram page, the app had to match the elegant, kinda artsy, but still inviting vibe of the DayTrip account.  </p>

                <p> In order to support our brand, making sure the app gave users the right feeling was my top priority when I approached the MVP design. At least for our first 1000 users, they share the values we promote. </p>

                <h2> Designing for 3 scenarios </h2>
                <p> When I first started designing, I didn't formally create personas since we were still – and still always are – talking to users (and again, #StartupsAreSpeedy). I did start with these use cases in mind: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong> Immediate </strong> – "I'm out & about and want to find somewhere to go right now." </li>
                    <li> <strong> Near-future </strong> – "I'm looking for a new place to visit this weekend with my partner or friend." </li>
                    <li> <strong> Future </strong> – "I'm keeping track of all the places I want to go to someday." </li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Thinking about these use cases helped me contextualize app flows in a user's journey, which was helpful in making decisions about the information architecture (with tabs organized to correspond to those use-cases) shown below:

                <h2> Creating a magazine-like browsing experience </h2>
                <p> The MVP started with an image-based feed of spaces in the first tab. Spaces are displayed one-at-a-time to emphasize the immersive effect of the photos. However, users felt this feed was too monotonous. We also noticed from analytics that people tended to stay on one tab, so other features weren't being accessed as often. 
                    To make the feed more dynamic and to better integrate the other content in our app (i.e. curations), the redesign includes different feed items. </p>

                <p> While beauty is important for this app, efficiency is everything for curators who are repeatedly adding pieces of content.  But the first iterations I designed? They were just not it. Bless Cherlyn's blood pressure for enduring it at least a hundred times before the redesign. She came up with the flow for adding photos (for spaces that already exist) and I created the flow for adding a completely new space. 
                    A sign of success is that curators (other than Cherlyn) were able to learn and use the new flow without any guidance from our team. We're still waiting for their feedback for more improvements. </p>

For the features we decide to implement in a sprint, Cherlyn creates wireframe sketches. We all discuss the proposed UX in a meeting or asynchronously on Notion.</p>
                <p> After checking on the feasibility of interactions with David, I work on higher-fidelity wireframes and a prototype. More rounds of discussion and iterations follow. David and Cherlyn also test prototypes (or even the functional implementation) with users and/or friends and relay the feedback. </p>
                <p> Finally, we also monitor Google analytics to measure success and find problem-areas (e.g. What percentage users successfully create an account? Which screen does the most drop-off happen on?). </p>
