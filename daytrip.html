                <h3> Overview </h3> 
                <p> The DayTrip app encourages people to explore their cities by using our curator-based space-discovery platform. We launched July 2020 in Seoul. As of October 2020, it has 1000+ downloads, with 300+ WAUs. </p>

                <h3> My Role </h3> 
                <p>Joining part-time in May 2020, I led the product design from the ground up. I collaborated with 3 other team members who did product, development, marketing, and user research.  </p>

                <h3>Background </h3> 
                <p>
                    Think of your favorite spots in town. What was it like when you first found them? Did you wonder "woah, why didn't I find this place sooner?" or "how could this be in [insert city here]?". We dream about exploring other places around the country and world, but how often have we experienced the gems hidden right in front of us? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Daytrip (born out the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ourspace/"> OurSpace </a> startup) makes it easy to discover these places. We give select content-curators a platform to share photos and info about the most special spaces in town. Besides the mobile app, DayTrip also maintains <a href="https://www.instagram.com/daytrip_korea/"> this Instagram page </a> to highlight spaces and curators in South Korea.

                <h3>Process </h3> 
                <p> Startups go fast – even if as a designer I prefer taking my sweet time to understand who I'm designing for, and why. I had to whip out some features in mere days within 1-week sprints. Users and future business value guided the development of every feature, so I also had to prioritize which designs were left at MVP-level and which ones to revisit. </p>

                <p> Daytrip is a team of 4 (3 former/current Blue Devils, 1 Cornelian) who collaborate remotely while running an agile process. This is an example feature-development timeline that typically happens over 1 or multiple sprints: </p>

                <h3>  Discovery </h3> 
                <p>Based on the DayTrip Instagram followers and David & Cherlyn's notes on conversations with potential users, these are the insights we operated on: </p>

                <h4> Pain-points </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong> Instagram is not suitable for offline exploration </strong> – Saving functionality locations is limited. Workarounds include keeping an album of screenshots and using the note-taking app. There is also not enough info/context about locations.</li>
                    <li> <strong> Lack of trust in review-based platforms like Yelp </strong> – There are fake reviews everywhere, and comments by strangers are taken with a grain-of-salt. Recommendations by friends and online influencers have the most weight.</li>
                    <li> <strong> Map services by Google, Naver, Apple, etc. are utility-focused </strong>– There is no inspiration to go to places, and the photos are often unappealing. </li>
                    <li> <strong> Difficult to explore together </strong> – People look for places to go on dates with partners (or friends/family), but planning is scattered across messages and tagging friends in comments on social media.  </li>
                    <li> <strong> Too many options </strong> – Seoul had over 80,000 restaurants alone (compared to 30,000 in NYC) in 2018. It is overwhelming to use services that simply list all these places, even with filters. </li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <h4>Customer insights </h4> 
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong> Demographics:  </strong>Young adults in their 20s - 30s (majority female), living in South Korea </li>
                    <li> <strong> Behaviors: </strong> Frequently go out (cafe-culture is huge) with their partner, friends, or family  </li>
                    <li> <strong> Likes:  </strong> Aesthetics (for the IG vibe!), lifestyle magazines/blogs/vlogs </li>

                </ul>
                <p>These insights mainly shaped the visual design decisions I made for the UI.  I value the connection between product design and branding, especially since the first touch-point for users is our Instagram page. It had to match the elegant, kinda artsy, but still inviting vibe of the DayTrip account. In order to support our brand, making sure the app gave users the right feeling was my top priority.  </p>
               <br>
                <h4>Use cases </h4> 
                <p> I didn't formally define personas, but I did design with these use cases in mind: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong> Immediate </strong> – "I'm out & about and want to find somewhere to go right now." </li>
                    <li> <strong> Near-future </strong> – "I'm looking for a new place to visit this weekend with my partner or friend." </li>
                    <li> <strong> Future </strong> – "I'm keeping track of all the places I want to go to someday." </li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Thinking about these use cases helped me contextualize app flows in a user's journey, which was helpful in making decisions about the information architecture (with tabs organized to correspond to those use-cases) shown below:

                <h2> Creating a magazine-like browsing experience </h2>
                <p> The MVP started with an image-based feed of spaces in the first tab. Spaces are displayed one-at-a-time to emphasize the immersive effect of the photos. However, users felt this feed was too monotonous. We also noticed from analytics that people tended to stay on one tab, so other features weren't being accessed as often. 
                    To make the feed more dynamic and to better integrate the other content in our app (i.e. curations), the redesign includes different feed items. </p>

                <p> While beauty is important for this app, efficiency is everything for curators who are repeatedly adding pieces of content.  But the first iterations I designed? They were just not it. Bless Cherlyn's blood pressure for enduring it at least a hundred times before the redesign. She came up with the flow for adding photos (for spaces that already exist) and I created the flow for adding a completely new space. 
                    A sign of success is that curators (other than Cherlyn) were able to learn and use the new flow without any guidance from our team. We're still waiting for their feedback for more improvements. </p>

For the features we decide to implement in a sprint, Cherlyn creates wireframe sketches. We all discuss the proposed UX in a meeting or asynchronously on Notion.</p>
                <p> After checking on the feasibility of interactions with David, I work on higher-fidelity wireframes and a prototype. More rounds of discussion and iterations follow. David and Cherlyn also test prototypes (or even the functional implementation) with users and/or friends and relay the feedback. </p>
                <p> Finally, we also monitor Google analytics to measure success and find problem-areas (e.g. What percentage users successfully create an account? Which screen does the most drop-off happen on?). </p>
