                    <h3> The Opportunity </h3>

                    <p><strong>Hundreds of thousands of visitors arrive on Duke University's campus each year.
                        </strong>Not only to watch games or tour campus as a prospective student, but to visit
                        attractions like the Nasher Museum of Art and Sarah P. Duke Gardens. With the upcoming opening
                        of an expensive visitor center, there's plenty of incentive to revamp the visitor experience.
                    </p>
                    <p> <strong> We decided to make a visitor app for the Duke Gardens first. </strong> After meeting
                        with multiple stakeholders (including Duke Athletics and one of Duke's executive VPs) , our team
                        decided to use the gardens as a proof of concept for a visitor app that could be expanded to the
                        rest of campus.</p>
                    <img width="100%" src="OITImages/DukeGardensBridge.jpg">
                    <p> The Sarah P. Duke Gardens is a sprawling botanical garden open to the public, attracting over
                        <strong>300,000 visitors </strong> each year. It is not only a top spot to see on campus, but
                        also the local Durham/Raleigh area. </p>
                    <p> <strong> Did someone say 'Augmented Reality'?</strong> Besides creating a visitor app, another
                        half of our project was focused on implementing the AR technology from our <a
                            href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/free/search/?&OCID=AID2000061_SEM_JEGssiWT&MarinID=JEGssiWT_324570645539_microsoft%20cloud%20azure_e_c__71931115868_aud-394034018130:kwd-302939704459&lnkd=Google_Azure_Brand&dclid=COCp9Oiw_uMCFQEO5wod-HsBxw"
                            target="_blank">project sponsor</a>. <br> We dreamed up possible applications of AR in our
                        app, however as the weeks progressed, we discovered that some of our plans were impossible with
                        our sponsor's technology. </p>

                    <p> <strong>My opportunity was working as a "UX team of one".</strong> Although we had a team lead
                        from Duke OIT, my team members' roles were mostly self-directed. This meant that I wanted to
                        incorporate elements of the design process in our work, I had to shape those opportunities
                        myself.</p>

                <h3> Research </h3>

                <h2> Field visits & interviews </h2>
                <p>To begin, my team made several trips to the Duke Gardens to observe visitors, conduct interviews with
                    gardens staff, and to experience the gardens for ourselves. One visit included a tour of the entire
                    gardens offered by volunteer tour guides. </p>
                <img width="100%" src="OITImages/dukegardens.png"><br><br>
                <p>We interviewed gardens staff, from tour guides to the marketing director. They shared with us some of
                    the <strong>most commonly asked questions from visitors:</strong></p>
                <br>
                <div id="visitorQuotes" style="text-align: center">
                    <p>"Where's the parking lot / bathroom / cafe / exit ?"</p>
                    <p>"Where should I go today?"</p>
                    <p>"How long does it take to visit?"</p>
                    <p>"Where is the rose garden?" (asked while standing in the Rose Garden)</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p> Here's the map that the gardens provides visitors. It's pretty, but it can be tricky to find which
                    twisty path you're on.</p>
                <img width="60%" style="margin: auto; display: block"

                <br>

                <p> Unsurprisingly, we found that <strong>visitors often struggle navigating using the paper
                        map</strong>. They don't use it every step of their visit, but it is crucial when they need to
                    find a specific place such as a bathroom, parking lot, or iconic landmark.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> The current visiting experience</h2><br>
                <img width="100%" src="OITImages/PastJourney.png"><br><br>

                <h2> User personas </h2>
                <p> From observations and informal conversations with gardens visitors, I created 3 "proto-personas" to
                    help guide the rest of our design process. </p>
                <div class="wrapper" id="personas">

                </div>

                <h2> Understanding stakeholders</h2>
                <p> At this stage, we also completed our initial stakeholder meetings with the gardens and Duke's
                    executive board. We asked about existing initatives and data, in addition to opportunities for
                    revenue-generation. These meetings gave us guidance on which aspects of the visitor experience to
                    focus on, in addition to the <strong>business requirements that aligned with user needs</strong>.

                <h2>How might we create a simple mobile experience that enables visitors to make the most of the
                    Gardens? </h2>
                <p>When my team began thinking about which features to incorporate in our app, <strong>I took initiative
                        in suggesting we use post-it notes to organize our ideas </strong>and try to create a "task
                    analysis". For each key stage in the visitor journey, we added ideas about both what features and
                    information a user would need.</p>

                <h2> Ideating together </h2>
                <p>To encourage participation and divergent thinking, I asked all of my team members to sketch out
                    design ideas before discussing our ideas as a group. </p>

                    <li> An easy-to-navigate map experience</li>
                    <li> Encourage exploration of different points of interest in the Gardens </li>
                    <li> Integrate self-guided tours that balance information with real-life exploration</li>

                    <h3> Wireframes</h3>
                    <h2>From low up to medium-fidelity</h2>
                    <p>Because this project could become part of Duke's suite of mobile apps, I did not define a
                        distinct visual design. I spoke to one of Duke OIT's UX/UI designers and learned that while OIT
                        did not have a mobile design/pattern system, they did sometimes <strong> take cues from Material
                            Design.</strong> I kept this in mind when deciding to use cards, drop shadows, and rounded
                        corners.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Getting guerilla feedback</h2>
                    <p> I asked several other interns at Duke OIT to walk through the wireframes and tell me what they
                        thought each screen’s function was. Everyone seemed to have a good grasp of what the app did,
                        although the concept of “saving” favorite locations sparked discussion. What if it could
                        generate a tour from the saved places?</p>

            <h3> Iterations </h3>
            <h2>Prototyping new features</h2>
            <p> My first set of wireframes were a simple, broad overview of the app. To explore new ideas and user flows
                in more detail, I created new wireframes and also a clickable prototype. Using the prototype, I asked
                testers to assume 2 scenarios: 1) Planning their own tour route and 2) Exploring nearby places. </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Testing results pt. 2</h2>
            <p> This time the other OIT interns were more confused as they progressed through the route-planning
                taskflow. They were <strong>mostly confused by the concept, rather than by what they saw on the
                    screens.</strong> This suggested that including onboarding might be necessary in order to provide
                users with enough information to build some sort of a conceptual model for this novel taskflow. </p>

            <p> <strong> Shouldn't we verify with actual gardens visitors? </strong> Using other interns to test was
                convenient, but it didn't tell me how much actual visitors would value being able to customize their
                routes. However at this point my team lead asked us to start coding, and I decided to stop exploring
                this concept after considering the value it could bring users would not outweigh the disproportionally
                large amount of time/effort to develop it. </p>

                <p> Armed with 3-days worth of XCode training, I began building our app's visual components in XCode's
                    storyboard and writing Swift code to make use of the data my teammates prepared on the back-end.</p>

                        product</strong> over those that would complicate and lengthen development. I questioned my

                <h3> Takeaways</h3>
                <h2>Knowing what's important and when to cut corners</h2>
                <p>In 10 weeks, there wasn't the luxury of progressing cleanly through the UX process like I had seen in
                    books, online articles, and Medium posts. When we were short on time, I applied modified, shortened
                    versions of processes that would deliver just enough value to use. Other times, especially with our
                    lack of user testing, I learned about the drawbacks of not going for the full push and how to
                    compromise. </p>
                <h2> Empathy for users and teammates</h2>
                <p> Teamwork makes the [UX] dream work! In order to convince my teammates that design was important, I
                    had to step in their shoes. "How could supporting this 'design thing' help them acheive their own
                    goals and ultimately benefit our team's work as a whole?" </p>
                <h2> Parlez-vous 'business'?</h2>
                <p>Since we were designing a new product, business value was key. The current app does not directly
                    support revenue-generation, and this is a hurdle in terms of bringing our app to
                    long-term/widespread production. If I were to do this again, I would consider business, user needs,
                    and technical constraints together at the same time to understand the ways they intersected and how
                    that would translate to a design. </p>
