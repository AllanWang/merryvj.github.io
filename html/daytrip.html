                <h3> Upgrading to V2.0 </h3>
                <p> Starting in May of 2020, I worked on Daytrip part-time at night after work/school. Version 1 of the app is exactly what you'd expect from an inexperienced, sleep-deprived designer fed on Dribbble juice.  </p>
                <h3> Improve retention </h3>
                <p> The redesign of the "Search" tab is part of larger efforts to improve first week retention. We saw that after onboarding, most people go directly to that tab to find relevant content. But many run into disappointing results and never come back. </p>

                </figure>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disappointing query results - The design of the filter selection
                        encourages people to punch in multiple selectors that return little-to-no relevant results. Content on the app is limited – on purpose.</li>
                    <li> It's tedious - Anecdotally from reviews, people feel like the search functionality is too
                        effortful to use. </li>
                    <li> Don't know what is available - Especially for first-time users, they have little knowledge of
                        the type of content on the app. And if a filter or search query does not return anything
                        relevant, people will modify the query and try again multiple times to no avail. </li>
                </ul>

                <h3> Insights from usage data </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Try search first - The majority of new and old users both make a beeline for the search tab on
                        first launch. Filtering happens 3x more than using the search bar. Many search bar queries are
                        also very specific e.g. "animation cafe." </li>
                    <li> Location, location, location - Half of all filters and searches are for regions. Many are for
                        destinations like Busan and Jeju Island (outside of Seoul) and the rest are smaller districts or
                        neighbourhoods within Seoul. </li>
                    <li> Long-term planning AND short-term "emergencies" - People go to the search tab both to plan out
                        a weekend trip (e.g. to Busan) and when trying to find nearby places on-the-go. This was a
                        surprise! The Home tab was originally designed to serve the planning use cases – and the Search
                        tab the ASAP use case. </li>
                </ul>

                <p> I sketched different interaction patterns and discussed with the team to see which ones were the

                <p> To address some of the other problems we uncovered, I explored these solutions: </p>
                <p> Instead of showing every single region in our database ever, feature the ones that have the most
                    content. </p>

                <p> Due to a time-crunch to line up with the easing of restrictions in Seoul, the following is the version we briefly tested with 3 current users and shipped. It was the safest option when considering how people may have imprinted to the original filter-selection mechanism. </p>

                <h3> Retention increased, but problems remain  </h3>
                <p> First-week retention leaped up 20% to an all-time high...that's definitely due to easing of restrictions! Filtering and search activity changed significantly (increased 40% and decreased 10%, respectively). But many issues were still not resolved – an app store review still noted the difficulty in the search function. </p>
