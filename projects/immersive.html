                <h3> Improve retention </h3>
                <p> The redesign of the Search tab is part of larger efforts to improve first week retention. After analyzing the entire user journey, I thought retention could be addressed most impactfully by addressing other stages of the experience – except the story told by the usage data was too urgent to ignore. 
                    We saw that after onboarding, most people make a beeline for the Search tab. Unfortunately after interacting with the filters and the search bar, many run into disappointing results and never come back. They've lost trust in Daytrip!  </p>
                
                <!-- <h3> Upgrading to V2.0 </h3>
                <p> Starting in May of 2020, I worked on Daytrip part-time at night after work/school. Version 1 of
                    the app is exactly what you'd expect from an inexperienced, sleep-deprived designer fed on
                    Dribbble juice. Improvements for Version 2 are an opportunity to fix my mistakes – and make new, but fewer, ones! Redesigns are needed to accomodate upcoming features for growth.   </p>
