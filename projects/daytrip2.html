                <h3> Improve retention </h3>
                <p> The redesign of the Search tab is part of larger efforts to improve first week retention. After analyzing the entire user journey, I thought retention could be addressed most impactfully by addressing other stages of the experience – except the story told by the usage data was too urgent to ignore. 
                    We saw that after onboarding, most people make a beeline for the Search tab. Unfortunately after interacting with the filters and the search bar, many run into disappointing results and never come back. They've lost trust in Daytrip!  </p>
                
                <!-- <h3> Upgrading to V2.0 </h3>
                <p> Starting in May of 2020, I worked on Daytrip part-time at night after work/school. Version 1 of
                    the app is exactly what you'd expect from an inexperienced, sleep-deprived designer fed on
                    Dribbble juice. Improvements for Version 2 are an opportunity to fix my mistakes – and make new, but fewer, ones! Redesigns are needed to accomodate upcoming features for growth.   </p>

                <p> Each space has metadata or "tags" about the type (e.g. cafe, library), feel (e.g. luxurious, cozy), and location. The old Search tab simply surfaced all the tags for people to build filter queries with. But this design didn't account for what would be most important for people searching in different contexts.  As a result, people had to fiddle with the filters or type in queries into a mysterious search bar – both cognitively demanding tasks. Complaints about the difficulty even showed up in an app review.    </p>

               <p> The design of the rest of the product targets two main personas but.   From previous interviews, we knew that people used Daytrip for 3 general jobs: </p>
               <ol>
                   <li> Finding somewhere to go to immediately #on-the-go</li>
                   <li> Discovering hidden gems in a neighborhood #browsing </li>
                    <li> Planning a weekend trip (e.g. to Busan, another major city in South Korea) #planning </li>
               </ol>

               <p> For V1, we designed the "Search" tab primarily for the first scenario (and the "Home" tab for all other planning/browsing). But after looking at the usage data and seeing how often – and how immediate – people filtered/searched by region, I decided the design of the tab should accomodate 
            </p>
                <!-- <ul>
                    <li> Try search first - The majority of new and old users both make a beeline for the search tab
                        on
                        first launch. Filtering happens 3x more than using the search bar. Many search bar queries
                        are
                        also very specific e.g. "animation cafe." </li>
                    <li> Location, location, location - Half of all filters and searches are for regions. Many are
                        for
                        destinations like Busan and Jeju Island (outside of Seoul) and the rest are smaller
                        districts or
                        neighbourhoods within Seoul. </li>
                    <li> Long-term planning AND short-term "emergencies" - People go to the search tab both to plan
                        out
                        a weekend trip (e.g. to Busan) and when trying to find nearby places on-the-go. This was a
                        surprise! The Home tab was originally designed to serve the planning use cases – and the
                        Search
                        tab the ASAP use case. </li>

                <p> Ideating with the team started out more "blue sky", especially since we wanted to explore new business opportunities in the redesign. I began by involving all 4 members of the team by borrowing a few pages from the GV design sprint. After gathering interaction patterns from apps our users were likely familiar with, we discussed which ones were
                    most desirable from the product and engineering perspective. </p>

                </figure>
                <p> We decided to explore select combos of different patterns, and I quickly created low-fi wireframes for discussion... </p>

                    <figcaption> This was around when we decided to make the search and map functions secondary. </figcaption>

                <p> The following is an "ideal" approach that accounted for future product developments, but given time constraints, we ultimately did not move forwards with it for the first release of the redesign.   </p>

                <p> </p>

                <p> To focus on problem-solving, I was also wireframing for the secondary screens. This allowed me to save time and develop more explorations before bringing them to discussion:   </p>
                <h4> Improved location selection </h4>
                <p> The data showed that a small handful of regions made up the majority of searches and filters that included a region, so it would be helpful if these regions were featured for easy access. </p>
                <!-- <p> Instead of showing every single region in our database ever, feature the ones that have the most
                    content. </p> -->

                <h4> Redirecting disappointment </h4>
                <p> 
                    When people use the search bar, their queries are tend to be quite specific – and ocassionally not very suitable for Daytrip's database and search functionaliy.  A common occurence was seeing people repeatedly make search attempts (up to 3 times), even modifying their query to try again when they couldn't find what they were looking for. </p>

                <p> Whenever possible, the app can make suggestions for other queries to try. Additionally, sending notifications in the future when the content exists (and encouraging space suggestions) is chance to re-engage people who would have not come back otherwise. </p>

                <p> Due to a time-crunch to line up with the easing of restrictions in Seoul, the following is the
                    version we briefly tested with 3 current users and shipped. It was the safest option when
                    considering how people may have imprinted to the original filter-selection mechanism. </p>

                <p> First-week retention after this release jumped up 20% to an all-time high. This is probably due to easing of
                    lockdown restrictions in Seoul! Many issues were still not resolved, and an unsatisfied app store review still noted
                    frustration. </p>

                <h3> Towards the second release </h3>
                <p> Informed by data on the most common filter/search queries, I designed and prototyped a feasible approach for the second release of the Search tab upgrade. This design makes a major trade-off in removing the ability for users to build precise queries with tags upfront. Instead, all interactions available on the primary screen ensures people can find a relevant space in the right place – and the probability of landing on disappointing results is minimized.    </p>

But the nitty gritty details factored into making the decision to actually go (including hours of operation, busy-ness) are limited on the app. Instead, there are wonderfully written descriptions by curators on the app.  </p> -->
                <p>The decision to surface the three action buttons came from thinking about the "jobs" people need Daytrip to do both when planning and when out-and-about (a job specific to the Search tab):  </p>

                <p> I originally prioritized the "Go" navigation button by making it the largest, but I ended up making them all equally sized to reduce the work that dev needs to do for setting iOS screen constraints. For now, the ordering of the actions is quite arbitrary. I'd like to find justification for it using some feedback from release.    </p>

                <p> A nice-to-have animation to make the meaning of the navigation minutes (the shortest time by either walking or Seoul's public transit) more clear: </p>
