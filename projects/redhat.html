                <p> Imagine you're a developer for PetCorp, and your team is working on a new adoption
                    website. To get the data that is displayed about the pets on the site, developers politely make requests 
                    to the Petstore API. Suddenly, management barges in with a new requirement: they want the site to show the
                    personality of each pet! Another developer makes the changes to the design of the API and
                    updates the database's "Pet" schema: </p>

                <p> This is where the Service Registry comes in. Now, developers can store all the data designs (APIs,
                    database schemas) and update them as they evolve – so that everyone on the development team can
                    stay up-to-date. It's kind of like git, but just for data. </p>

                <p> The Service Registry is already in use without a UI. In preparation for future product
                    development, the engineers built an MVP version with a basic one. My goal was to improve the design
                    so that it would be compatible with future business requirements and consistent with
                    other products in the Integration suite. </p>

                <p> Some constraints for the design:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong> Backwards compatibility </strong> – The new design had to be compatible with the way the existing backend
                        of the Service Reigstry was structured.

                    Within the product team, I worked primarily with the lead engineer. He was the main stakeholder with
                    whom I validated most of the design decisions.  While I was individually responsible for all of the design deliverables (competitive analysis, IA diagrams, early-stage explorations, prototypes), I had incredible support and a source of feedback from 3 designers through weekly design reviews and 1:1s.

                    Welcome to the project kick-off! Features and requirements were still up in the air, and I was working in parallel with product and engineering's work. After scoping things down, we identified 4 main UX challenges. I mainly focused on these 2:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong> All artifacts view </strong> – How might we help users find an artifact quickly and with confidence?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong> Artifact details view </strong> – How might users interact with an artifact and its versions?

                <p> We started doing some blue-sky thinking after discussing the competitive analysis. At low-fidelity, I quickly created some explorations for further discussion, however in the interest of time, we decided to focus on solving problems that could be addressed using the existing functionality.  </p>

                <h2> For user goals, not just tasks </h2>
            </div>
            <div>


                <p> I was designing for a general "Developer" persona, although I had little information about their workflow for anything specific to the Service Registry. So more insight into user goals and context, I rewrote engineering's task-based use cases to follow the job story approach. For example: </p>

                    <blockquote> <strong>Task:</strong> Find an artifact (from the list or through a search query)<br><br>
                        <strong>Job story 1:</strong> When an artifact needs updating, I want to get quickly to the place to make changes so that I do
                        not waste time looking for it.<br><br>
                        <strong>Job story 2:</strong> When I need a data source, I want to find something relevant so that I can make
                        proper use of it in a project I am working on. 
                       
                    
                    </blockquote>
                <p> What a game-changer! Before, I didn't even realize there were two distinct contexts for that one task. As imperfect the stories were (they were full of unchecked assumptions), they were able to inform my approach solving the first design challenge. </p>

                <p><strong> Displaying data in a table vs. grid </strong> </p>
              <p>
                        Based on the stories, it seemed like there were 2 distinct contexts to design for: hunting for
                        a specific artifact and discovering an artifact. It would make sense to organize and display the data in a way that is
                        suitable for those different contexts.
                    </p>
                    <p> A table or list with filtering and sorting options would support a user who is searching/systematically locating a
                        specific artifact. A grid view with cards is better suited for "discovery", where a user may
                        need the help of longer descriptions to understand what the artifact is. </p>

                </figure>

                <p> We decided it was feasible to go with both because the ability to toggle between a list and grid view already existed in another closely related Red Hat product.  </p>


                <!-- <h4> MVP </h4>
                <p> The main issue is that with likely dozens to hundreds of artifacts stored in the registry, it may be
                    difficult for a user to find what they are looking for quickly and with confidence. </p>

                <p><strong> Preview for confidence </strong> </p>

                <p> To make up for any shortcomings in the data shown in the list or card items, I thought a way to preview
                    might
                    help users confirm they are accessing the right artifact. The ability to preview also is common pattern in other developer-loved
                    applications such as Github and some API management software. </p>

                </figure>

                <p> Option B was more desirable considering that, especially in the context of discovery, users may find it helpful to quickly click through and preview multiple artifacts.</p>

            <div>
                <p> The main challenge was understanding the functionality and data represented by this view. Because it had a decent amount of complexity to figure out, I didn't jump right into the design. I started by doing a content audit and using diagrams to facilitate Q&As with stakeholders. </p>
              
                <p> The diagrams helped me uncover a few more technical details, but I was having trouble using them to
                    communicate with the engineering stakeholders and needed to transition into wireframing for more clarity. </p>
                <figure>

                    <figcaption> There were still some unanswered questions after exploring the information architecture through diagrams.  </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p> <strong> Handling multiple active versions </strong></p>
                <p> The most important insight here was that the versioning of an artifact isn't
                    necessarily linear. So the version that could be of interest to the user isn't always the most
                    recent one, especially when there may be different versions for multiple projects/applications. </p>
                

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/projects/redhat/detailscomp.png">
                </figure>

                <p> After discussing the priority of use cases with the stakeholders, we went with Option A. It
                    would allow users to easily toggle between versions, which supports their ability to make
                    comparisons and contextualize changes. </p>

                <p> Now that the larger design decisions had been ironed out with the team, it was time to explore the details and some secondary use cases. 
                    I quickly created some more low/med-fi wireframes and sought another round of stakeholder feedback. Except this was right when the lead engineer, AKA the main stakeholder, suddenly went on PTO for 3 weeks. Oh no! 
                 </p>
                 
                 <p>
                    I usually want to validate my riskier ideas before going into higher-fidelity and visual design. Since that was no longer an option and time was running out, it was best to start fleshing out the design
                    using the Patternfly design system components.
                 </p>

                </figure>

                <p>
                    I went through multiple rounds of explorations and design reviews in the 3 weeks. Unfortunately when the lead engineer returned, we realized that many designs contradicted the back-end data model. 
                </p>

                <p>
                   How did we finally work out the small, yet frustrating technicalities? Unconventional, but it worked: I got access to the API that powered the Service Registry and saw the functionality for myself. Being a computer science major certainly helped!

                <p> Once I wrapped up my iterations on the artifact details screen, it was time to identify the areas
                    that were successful and those that needed more iteration from future designers on the product. I
                    prepared a clickable prototype in Marvel and with the guidance of a user researcher, I drafted a
                    30-minute script that included a task analysis. The moderator was to record whether or not the participant had
                    successfully completed each task and how difficult the participant thought it was. </p>
                <p> We were not able to finish recruiting test participants before the end of my internship, although I
                    was able to moderate an internal test run to find points in the script to edit. #testingthetest</p>

                <p> The solutions shared in the final presentations to the stakeholders (and Red Hat's UX org) were well received. I passed documentation to the designer who would be taking over the project after my internship, and we discussed areas for further focus. Beyond additional flows and edge cases, we noted refinements to be made in the UX copy and research to be done in investigating search & filtering behaviors.  </p>
