            <div>
                <h3> "A datastore for artifacts: schemas and API designs"</h3>

                <p> Imagine you're a developer for PetCorp, and your team is working on a new adoption
                    website. To get the data that is displayed about the pets on the site, developers make calls to the Petstore API. Suddenly, management barges in with a new requirement: they want the site to show the personality of each pet! Joey, another developer, makes the changes to the design of the API and updates the database's "Pet" schema: </p>

                    </figure>
    

                <p> This is where the Service Registry comes in. Now, developers can store all the data designs (APIs,
                    database schemas) and update them as they evolve, so that everyone on the development team can
                    access them. Once integrated with the development environment, the Service Registry also ensures the
                    data being sent and recieved by the application is "up-to-date". </p>

                <h2> Constraints </h2>
            </div>

            <div>

                <h3> Backwards compatibility </h3>
                <p> No changes were to be made to the existing Service Registry backend that customers currently made
                    use of. The new design had to be compatible with the way the existing backend was structured. This
                    was unlike most other projects where the server-side engineering happens in tandem with, or slightly
                    behind, design. </p>

                <h3> Aligning with the design system </h3>
                <p> Red Hat's UX organization was working on updating to the newly released Patternfly 4. The team
                    working on the Integration suite of products was also working on standardizing conventions. So the
                    design choices I made for the Service Registry needed to be as consistent with related products as
                    possible, in addition to avoiding the design of new UI components.
                </p>

                <h3> No customers yet, no user research ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </h3>
                <p> Because this is a product type that is fairly new and not widely adopted, there weren't any specific
                    insights from interviews with developers. Without a clear understanding of user goals and workflows,
                    my work was informed mainly by functionality requirements gathered from engineering stakeholders.   </p>

                    feedback to build off of. So for better insights into the main usability issues and pain-points due
                    to the design choices in the MVP, I – as a novice user – ran through a demo. </p>

                <h3> Understanding competitors </h3>

                <p> Because my work began during the stage when the product features were still being defined, I had
                    opportunity to advocate for features that would improve the UX. I presented an analysis to
                    facilitate a conversation with product and engineering, which is when we determine the scope of my
                    focus. </p>

                <h3> Understanding developers </h3>

                    and other products in the Red Hat Integration suite. In order to design something that developers can easily pick up, it helps when I'm familiar with what they are already used to. </p>

                <p> At the end of the 3 weeks I spent on research, I had a clear idea of what tasks I would be designing
                    for – but I didn't really understand the user goals behind those tasks. I also was designing just
                    for the "Developer" persona, although the insights about them seemed too general to drive my
                    decisions. For more insight into user goals, I wrote the following "user stories" (inspired by
                    the job story approach): </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When I need to find a data source, I want to find something relevant so that I can make
                        use of it in the project I am working on.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        When an artifact needs updating, I want to get quickly to the place to make changes so that I do
                        not
                        waste time.
                    </li>

                    <li>When I am referencing an artifact, I want easy access to helpful resources so that I can speed
                        up my development process. </li>
                </ul>

                    validated most of the design decisions. Unfortunately for me, he unexpectedly went on PTO for 3

                    creating a usability testing script.

                <h3> All artifacts view – Looking for an artifact </h3>

                <p> Based on the user stories, it seemed like there were 2 distinct scenarios to design for: hunting for
                    a specific artifact and discovering an artifact. The data should be displayed in a way that is
                    suitable for the different user goal of each scenario.

                    <h4> Displaying data in a table vs. grid </h4>
                    <p> A table or list with filtering and sorting options would help a user systematically find a
                        specific artifact. A grid view with cards is better suited for "discovery", where a user may
                        need the help of the description to understand what the artifact is. </p>


                </p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/projects/redhat/listvsgrid.png">
                    <figcaption> </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p> Thankfully the ability to toggle between two different views is already in use in a related product
                    so after checking with engineering, I proposed the use of both the table and grid. But I wasn't sure
                    what data to include in the design of the table item or card – what information would be most
                    critical for users? </p>

                <!-- <h4> MVP </h4>
                <p> The main issue is that with likely dozens to hundreds of artifacts stored in the registry, it may be
                    difficult for a user to find what they are looking for quickly and with confidence. </p>

                    <figcaption> This simple list view with pagination works, but it could be better. </figcaption>
                </figure> -->

                <h4> Preview for confidence </h4>
                <!-- <p> I saw how a competitor divided "artifacts" into different "registries", which inspired me to
                    consider ways to organize artifacts so that users have more confidence in knowing where to look.
                    During the low-fi stages, I explored ideas such as artifact groups and a favouriting feature. The
                    idea of groups was well recieved by product and engineering, but we decided further exploration was
                    out of scope for the time I had left. </p> -->
                <p> To make up for any shortcomings in the data shown in the table items, I decided a way to preview
                    would
                    help users confirm they are accessing the right artifact – which is especially helpful in the
                    browsing scenario. The ability to preview also is common pattern in other developer-loved
                    applications such as Github and some API management softwares. </p>

                <h3> Artifact detail view - Managing the artifact and its versions </h3>
                <p>The design of this screen was the most challenging. It had to support multiple user tasks related to
                    the referencing, editing, state management, etc. of the different versons of an artifact. Figuring
                    out the information architecture first was key to make sure the design was an accurate
                    representation of the data model that already existed on the backend. </p>
                <h4> Information architecture attempts </h4>
                <p> I started by trying to create a content audit to help me understand all of the technical details
                    upfront. However, I learned that the stakeholder team had ambiguous requirements for the content due
                    to on-going planning for future features. We decided to just base my design on the MVP, which I
                    referenced to diagram a few information architecture proposals: </p>

                </figure>

                <p> The diagrams helped me uncover a few more technical details, but I was having trouble using them to
                    communicate with the engineering stakeholders. I jumped into low-fidelity wireframing with the goal
                    of using them to validate the data representation. #KnowWhatIWantWhenISeeIt</p>
                <h4> Handling multiple active versions </h4>
                <p> The most important "insight" for this design decision was that the versioning of an artifact isn't
                    necessarily linear. So the version that could be of interest to the user isn't always the most
                    recent one, especially when there may be different versions for multiple projects/applications. </p>
                <!-- <p> There may be multiple versions of an artifact that are "active" and up to dozens of versions. A
                    dropdown would not be suited for displaying a large number of versions, and it suggests that the
                    latest version is the only one of interest (which might not always true in the case of the Service
                    Registry). </p> -->

                <p> After discussing the priority of use cases with the team, we decided to proceed with Option A. It
                    would allow users to quickly toggle between versions, which would support their ability to make
                    comparisons and contextualize changes. I created another set of wireframes based on the discussion
                    and to account for additional use cases, but the lead engineer went on PTO before I could validate
                    them with him. </p>
                <p> I usually want to validate my ideas before going into higher-fidelity and visual design. Except with
                    the main stakeholder absent and little time remaining, it was best to start fleshing out the design
                    using Patternfly components. </p>

                </figure>

                <p> The main issue was that the design contradicted the back-end data model. Other designers also
                    pointed out that there was clutter and no hiearchy to all the actions sprinkled across the screen.

                </figure>

                <p> By now the lead engineer had returned (yay!) and I was able to make the last few iterations with his
                    input. </p>

                <p> There's some unrefined design choices to revisit, but the main structure was
                    established and ready for testing. </p>

                <p> Once I wrapped up my iterations on the artifact details screen, it was time to identify the areas
                    that were successful and those that needed more iteration from future designers on the product. I
                    prepared a clickable prototype in Marvel and with the guidance of a user researcher, I drafted a
                    30-minute script for a task analysis. The moderator would record whether or not the participant had
                    successfully completed each task and how difficult the participant thought it was. </p>
                <p> We were not able to finish recruiting test participants before the end of my internship, although I
                    was able to moderate a test run to find areas in the script to adjust. #testingthetest</p>
