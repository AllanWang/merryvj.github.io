                <p> For people using Daytrip to find interesting places to go to in Seoul, the Search tab is a
                    disappointing experience due to unreliable filters and lack of context awareness.

                    for the Search tab after onboarding. </p>

                <p>
                    The "aha" moment is when people save 5 spaces on their first session – because wow, they've
                    discovered all these hidden gems and feel inspired to go visit!</p>
                <p> But the majority of users (new and old) always make a beeline for the Search tab. A common occurrence
                    was seeing people leave, and even never come back, after interacting with filters/searches that have
                    irrelevant or no results. We also heard how difficult the search experience was through reviews.
                    Along with the evidence from the usage data, I became convinced that this was the most urgent
                    problem (out of at least 99 others) to solve with the greatest impact and least engineering effort
                    required. </p>

                <h3> Upgrading to V2.0 </h3>
                <p> Starting in May of 2020, I worked on Daytrip part-time at night after work/school. Version 1 of
                    the app is exactly what you'd expect from an inexperienced, sleep-deprived designer fed on
                    Dribbble juice. Improvements for Version 2 are an opportunity to fix my mistakes – and make new, but fewer, ones! Redesigns are needed to accomodate upcoming features for growth.   </p>

                <h3> Hit em' with a wall of filters...</h3>
                <p> Each space has metadata or "tags" about the type (e.g. cafe, library), feel (e.g. luxurious, cozy),
                    and location. The old Search tab simply surfaced all the tags for people to build filter queries
                    with. But this design didn't account for what would be most important for people searching in
                    different contexts. As a result, people had to fiddle with the filters or type in queries into a
                    mysterious search bar – both cognitively demanding tasks. Complaints about the difficulty even
                    showed up in an app review. </p>

                <p> From the usage data, I saw how often – and immediate – people filtered or search by region during their session. Based on past interviews conducted by other team members, I also knew that people used Daytrip in 3 main scenarios: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Finding somewhere nearby #on-the-go</li>
                    <li> Discovering hidden gems in a neighborhood #browsing </li>
                    <li> Planning a weekend trip (e.g. to Busan, another major city in South Korea) #planning </li>
                </ol>

                <p>  <strong> Takeaway: </strong> Let people set their location context upfront so that the experience of the session can adapt to their needs in each scenario. </p>

                <p> Daytrip has a preference-selection feature (that feeds into a personalized Home tab), but it assumes people's preferences are static. It turns out that depending on the time of day, day in the week, and seasonality, people are looking for different things. For example, there are more searches for restaurants around dinner time. And there is way more interest in outdoor spaces during these *cough* *cough* times.  </p>
                <p>  <strong> Takeaway: </strong> Help people find relevant content more easily by surfacing the most timely space types and attributes. </p>

            <div>
            
                <p> Because our goals for the redesign included identifying business opportunities and aligning with
                    future product direction, I led the rest of the team (3 other members across product, engineering, and marketing) through a round of ideation. We converged after compiling interaction patterns from apps our users were likely familiar with, and I wireframed some
                    quick explorations for discussion. </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/projects/daytrip/sketches.png">
                </figure>


                <p> To focus on problem-solving, I was also wireframing for the secondary screens. The following two proposals were implemented using existing design components and immediately shipped. 
                </p>
                <p> <strong> Problem: Selecting the location of interest is difficult </strong></p>
                <p> We previously displayed region tags for users to filter with (i.e. one tag per every neighbourhood in Seoul's 25 districts + other cities). Selecting them one-by-one made for a tiring and unintuitive user experience – what if I just want to see everything in one district instead of selecting all the individual neighbourhood tags? So, some people just used the search bar to query for location...and others built ungainly multi-tag queries.</p>

                <p> The solution shown below is a location selector view that emphasizes the handful of regions that make up the largest chunk of interest (based on the usage data). Nearby regions are also surfaced for easy access. If someone has a different region in mind, they can simply find it through the embedded search bar.
                <!-- <p> Instead of showing every single region in our database ever, feature the ones that have the most
                    content. </p> -->

                <figure class="half-size">
                    <img src="../images/projects/daytrip/LocationSelectorWire.png">
                </figure>

                <p> <strong>  Problem: Disappointment due to lack of content or irrelvant results </strong></p>
                <p>
                    When people use the search bar, their queries are tend to be quite specific – and perhaps not
                    very suitable for Daytrip's currently limited database and search functionality. A common occurrence was seeing people
                    repeatedly make search attempts, even modifying their query to try again when they
                    couldn't find what they were looking for. The lack-of-content problem also came up when people selected regions that just didn't have much. </p>

                    <p> Whenever possible, the app should make suggestions for other queries/filters to try. Additionally, sending
                        notifications in the future when the content exists (and encouraging space suggestions) is chance to
                        re-engage people who would have not come back otherwise. </p>

            <div>
                <p> Due to a time-crunch to line up with the easing of restrictions in Seoul, the following is the
                    version we briefly tested with 3 current users and shipped. Instead of showing all the tag filters at the gate, content is available upfront. This was the safest option (considering how people may have imprinted on the original menu of filters) and required minimal dev work.

                <p> This release was only a temporary compromise. Filtering activity increased and use of the search bar decreased – which is good since search is more cognitively demanding – but we weren't seeing much change in the metrics that mattered. Plus, an unsatisfied app store review still noted
                    frustration at "search [being] too difficult". </p>

                <p> With a little more time and bandwidth on the development side to work with, I made visual refinements to the hiearchy of the Search (now technically the "Discover") tab's initial view:  </p>

                    <strong> Card design upgrade </strong>

                </p>

                <p> While this does not relate to the main problem, I want to provide some more context as to why the cards displaying the spaces are designed this way. Each space on Daytrip has content (photos and text posts) from curators. One post is featured and visible from the list for each space. A space's photos have been emphasized ever since V1 after hearing how the emotional impact of beautiful photos are key in getting people interested in visiting.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../images/projects/daytrip/cardredesign.png">
                </figure>

                 <p> The decision to now include the 3 action buttons came from discovering small gaps in the discovery journey (using the jobs-to-be-done framework). Before, people could only access the save-to-a-list feature. If they actually wanted to go, they had to tap into the details view to manually copy & paste the address elsewhere. The info button is included  because people may sometimes tap on the card to read more of the featured post, and other times they need to get directly to the logistical info. </p>
                <!-- <p> Photos are prioritized because from earlier user research, we knew that people become interested in going to a place when they are inspired by beautiful photos that have emotional impact. But the nitty gritty details factored into making the decision to actually go (including hours of operation, busy-ness) are limited on the app. Instead, there are wonderfully written descriptions by curators on the app.  </p> -->

                    For now, the ordering of the actions is quite arbitrary. I'd like to find justification for it using
                    some feedback from release. </p> -->

                <p> Here's also a nice-to-have animation to make the meaning of the navigation minutes (the shortest time by
                    either
                    walking or Seoul's public transit) more clear: </p>

                <p> The polished design is now <del>in development</del> partially released, with a bit more dev work underway. The team is keeping an eye on the average # of spaces users save per session. This metric is based on the "aha moment" where people who return to the app usually save ~5 spaces on their first session. So if the redesigned search tab does a better job of helping people find relevant spaces to visit, we should see an increase in the saves – and later on, the check-ins.    </p>
